Introduction
-----
You should work on the implementation of this project.

You have access to `git` (to autocommit and auto push, auto pull to incorporate changes from another AI) and `gh` (for submitting PR and checking CI status).


Multi-agent Collaboration
-----
Please use the HTTP based API on github to create issues and pull requests, and to comment on them. Read `GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION.md` for how to authenticate yourself as a GitHub App.

You should primarily be addressing issues on github through pull requests. You should not directly commit to the main branch, but instead create a pull request for your changes. You should prepare your changes for maintainer to review.

You should always work in feature branches, and not the main branch.
Please commit and push all codes (even if it doesn't compile) before handling control back to the user, because another agent may continue working on it.
You will also likely take work from other agents and work on them. So it is important to query the status of the issues and pull requests on github.

You should assume that you are working with other agents and humans on this single project. Merge conflicts are unavoidable. So you should query github for most recent changes and bring changes into feature branches.

Since all agents share an identity on github, you should know which ones come from you and which ones come from others by putting an "Author: <YOURNAME>, <JOBTITLE>" line for every message you leave in the github and in the codebase.
