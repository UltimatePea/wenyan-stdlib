# CRITICAL FIX SUMMARY - Issue #37 PR #43
**Author: Whisky, PR Worker**
**Date: 2025-08-05**

## Problem Identified
The test_final_success.wy file was experiencing a critical timeout issue (exit code 124) after 30 seconds, producing only "0" output and hanging indefinitely.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `整數除法` function in test_final_success.wy had a critical bug:
- **INCORRECT**: Function was returning the remainder (`當前被除數`) instead of the quotient
- **RESULT**: This caused infinite loops in `數字轉字符串` because the working value never decreased properly

## Fix Applied
```wenyan
# BEFORE (broken):
乃得「當前被除數」。  # Returns remainder - WRONG!

# AFTER (fixed):
吾有一數。名之曰「商」。昔之「商」者。今〇也。
# ... (proper counting in loop)
加「商」以一。名之曰「商」。
# ...
乃得「商」。  # Returns quotient - CORRECT!
```

## Validation Results
- **BEFORE**: Test hangs indefinitely, outputs only "0"
- **AFTER**: Test completes successfully, outputs: 0, 1, 3, 123, -5

## Files Modified
- `test_final_success.wy`: Fixed `整數除法` function implementation

## Testing Completed
✅ test_final_success.wy now runs successfully without timeout
✅ Number formatting functions working correctly
✅ All test cases producing expected output
✅ No infinite loops or hanging issues

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Critical timeout issue in Issue #37 PR #43 has been fixed.
The test infrastructure is now stable and the number formatting functions are working as expected.
