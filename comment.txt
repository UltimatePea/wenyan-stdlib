PR #6 Validation Results: PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Issue Should Remain OPEN

After comprehensive testing and code analysis of the merged PR #6, while basic compilation and simple operations work, significant implementation gaps remain that prevent full resolution of Issue #4.

Confirmed Working Features:
- Basic Functions: 取字符串長度, 拼接字符串, 字符串為空 work correctly
- Compilation: String library compiles without syntax errors  
- Simple Operations: Length calculation, concatenation, empty checks function properly

Critical Issues Still Present:
1. Hardcoded Implementations Remain - Lines 166-191: Individual character mappings (a→A, b→B, etc.)
2. Incomplete Algorithm Implementation - String search only does equality comparison
3. Limited Scope - Case conversion only works for predefined strings

Issue Status Recommendation: KEEP ISSUE #4 OPEN - Significant work remains to achieve the comprehensive string library promised.
